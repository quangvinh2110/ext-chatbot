The latest customer query is asking about properties that are similar to a specific project but have a better price. The table 'BĐS Cho thuê 500' contains information about rental properties, including the 'Dự án' (Project) column and 'Giá thuê (triệu/tháng)' (Rental Price in million VND per month). These columns are directly relevant to the query as they relate to project names and pricing, which are key factors in comparing properties. Other columns like 'Loại BĐS' (Property Type) could also be considered for similarity, but the main focus is on the project and price.
